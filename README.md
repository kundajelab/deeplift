While DeepLIFT does not require your models to be trained with any particular library, we have provided autoconversion functions to convert models trained using Keras into the DeepLIFT format. If you used a different library to train your models, you can still use DeepLIFT if you recreate the model using DeepLIFT layers.

The original implementation of DeepLIFT uses a theano backend, but an alpha version of the tensorflow implementation (developed using tensorflow 0.12.0rc and Keras 1.1.2) is available. If you want to use the tensorflow branch, you can do `git checkout tensorflow` when in the deeplift repository. Run `nosetests tests/*` to make sure all the unit tests pass on your machine.

The theano implementation of DeepLIFT depends on theano >= 0.8 and autoconversion with sequential models was tested using keras 0.2, 0.3 and 1.1.2. Graph models were tested with keras 0.3. Autoconversion for the functional API is on the way.

The recommended way to obtain theano and numpy is through [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

##Quickstart

These examples show how to autoconvert a keras model and obtain importance scores.

```python
#Convert a keras sequential model
import deeplift
from deeplift.conversion import keras_conversion as kc
#NonlinearMxtsMode defines the method for computing importance scores. Other supported values are:
#Gradient, DeconvNet, GuidedBackprop and GuidedBackpropDeepLIFT (a hybrid of GuidedBackprop and DeepLIFT where
#negative multipliers are ignored during backpropagation)
deeplift_model = kc.convert_sequential_model(
                    keras_model,
                    nonlinear_mxts_mode=deeplift.blobs.NonlinearMxtsMode.DeepLIFT)

#Specify the index of the layer to compute the importance scores of.
#In the example below, we find scores for the input layer, which is idx 0 in deeplift_model.get_layers()
find_scores_layer_idx = 0

#Compile the function that computes the importance scores
#For sigmoid or softmax outputs, target_layer_idx should be -2 (the default)
#(See "a note on final activation layers" in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.01713v2.pdf for justification)
#For regression tasks with a linear output, target_layer_idx should be -1
#(which simply refers to the last layer)
#FYI: In the case of NonlinearMxtsMode.DeepLIFT, the importance scores are also called "contribution scores"
#If you want the multipliers instead of the contribution scores, you can use get_target_multipliers_func
deeplift_contribs_func = deeplift_model.get_target_contribs_func(
                            find_scores_layer_idx=find_scores_layer_idx,
                            target_layer_idx=-1)

#compute scores on inputs
#input_data_list is a list containing the data for different input layers
#eg: for MNIST, there is one input layer with with dimensions 1 x 28 x 28
#In the example below, let X be an array with dimension n x 1 x 28 x 28 where n is the number of examples
#task_idx represents the index of the node in the output layer that we wish to compute scores.
#Eg: if the output is a 10-way softmax, and task_idx is 0, we will compute scores for the first softmax class
scores = np.array(deeplift_contribs_func(task_idx=0,
                                         input_data_list=[X],
                                         batch_size=10,
                                         progress_update=1000))
```

This will work for sequential models involving dense and/or conv2d layers and linear/relu/sigmoid/softmax or prelu activations. Please create a github issue or email the address at the top of the readme if you are interested in support for other layer types.

The syntax for autoconverting graph models is similar:

```python
#Convert a keras graph model
import deeplift
from deeplift.conversion import keras_conversion as kc
deeplift_model = kc.convert_graph_model(
                    keras_model,
                    nonlinear_mxts_mode=deeplift.blobs.NonlinearMxtsMode.DeepLIFT)
#For sigmoid or softmax outputs, this should be the name of the linear layer preceding the final nonlinearity
#(See "a note on final activation layers" in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.01713v2.pdf for justification)
#For regression tasks with a linear output, this should simply be the name of the final layer
#You can find the name of the layers by inspecting the keys of deeplift_model.get_name_to_blob()
deeplift_contribs_func = deeplift_model.get_target_contribs_func(
    find_scores_layer_name="name_of_input_layer",
    pre_activation_target_layer_name="name_goes_here")

```

Support for the Keras functional API is in the works.

##Under the hood
This section explains finer aspects of the deeplift implementation

###Blobs
The blob (`deeplift.blobs.core.Blob`) is the basic unit; it is the equivalent of a "layer", but was named a "blob" so as not to imply a sequential structure. `deeplift.blobs.core.Dense` and `deeplift.blobs.convolution.Conv2D` are both examples of blobs.

Blobs implement the following key methods:
####get_activation_vars()
Returns symbolic variables representing the activations of the blob. For an understanding of symbolic variables, refer to the documentation of symbolic computation packages like theano or tensorflow.

####get_mxts()
Returns symbolic variables representing the multipliers on this layer (for the selected output). Refer to the DeepLIFT paper for an explanation of what multipliers are.

####get_target_contrib_vars()
Returns symbolic variables representing the importance scores. This is a convenience function that returns `self.get_mxts()*self.get_diff_from_default_vars()`

###The Forward Pass
Here are the steps necessary to implement a forward pass. If executed correctly, the results should be identical (within numerical precision) to a forward pass of your original model, so this is definitely worth doing as a sanity check. Note that if autoconversion (as described in the quickstart) is an option, you can skip steps (1) and (2).

1. Create a blob object for every layer in the network
2. Tell each blob what its inputs are via the `set_inputs` function. The argument to `set_inputs` depends on what the blob expects
  - If the blob has a single blob as its input (eg: Dense layers), then the argument is simply the blob that is the input
  - If the blob takes multiple blobs as its input, the argument depends on the specific implementation - for example, in the case of a Concat layer, the argument is a list of blobs 
3. Once every blob is linked to its inputs, you may compile the forward propagation function with `deeplift.backend.function([input_layer.get_activation_vars()...], output_layer.get_activation_vars())`
  - If you are working with a model produced by autoconversion, you can access individual blobs via `model.get_layers()` for sequential models (where this function would return a list of blobs) or `model.get_name_to_blob()` for Graph models (where this function would return a dictionary mapping blob names to blobs) 
  - The first argument is a list of symbolic tensors representing the inputs to the net. If the net has only one input blob, then this will be a list containing only one tensor
  - The second argument is the output of the function. In the example above, it is a single tensor, but it can also be a list of tensors if you want the outputs of more than one blob
4. Once the function is compiled, you can use `deeplift.util.run_function_in_batches(func, input_data_list)` to run the function in batches (which would be advisable if you want to call the function on a large number of inputs that wont fit in memory)
  - `func` is simply the compiled function returned by `deeplift.backend.function`
  - `input_data_list` is a list of numpy arrays containing data for the different input layers of the network. In the case of a network with one input, this will be a list containing one numpy array
  - Optional arguments to `run_function_in_batches` are `batch_size` and `progress_update`

###The Backward Pass
Here are the steps necessary to implement the backward pass, which is where the importance scores are calculated. Ideally, you should create a model through autoconversion (described in the quickstart) and then use `model.get_target_contribs_func` or `model.get_target_multipliers_func`. Howver, if that is not an option, read on (please also consider sending us a message to let us know, as if there is enough demand for a feature we will consider adding it). Note the instructions below assume you have done steps (1) and (2) under the forward pass section.

1. For the blob(s) that you wish to compute the importance scores for, call `reset_mxts_updated()`. This resets the symbolic variables for computing the multipliers. If this is the first time you are compiling the backward pass, this step is not strictly necessary.
2. For the output blob(s) containing the neuron(s) that the importance scores will be calculated with respect to, call `set_scoring_mode(deeplift.blobs.ScoringMode.OneAndZeros)`.
    - Briefly, this is the scoring mode that is used when we want to find scores with respect to a single target neuron. Other kinds of scoring modes may be added later (eg: differences between neurons).
    - A point of clarification: when we eventually compile the function, it will be a function which computes scores for only a single output neuron in a single layer every time it is called. The specific neuron and layer can be toggled later, at runtime. Right now, at this step, you should call `set_scoring_mode` on all the target layers that you might conceivably want to find the scores with respect to. This will save you from having to recompile the function to allow a different target layer later.
    - For Sigmoid/Softmax output layers, the output blob that you use should be the linear blob (usually a Dense layer) that comes before the final nonlinear activation. See "a note on final activation layers" in [the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.01713v2.pdf) for justification. If there is no final nonlinearity (eg: in the case of many regression tasks), then the output blob should just be the last linear blob. 
    - For Softmax outputs, you should additionally mean-normalize the weights across all softmax classes when creating the Dense blob. A utility function to perform this mean-normalization is `deeplift.util.get_mean_normalised_softmax_weights(W, b)`. Note that this transformation does not affect the forward propagation. See "a note on softmax activation" in [the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.01713v2.pdf) for a justification of why we do this.
3. For the blob(s) that you wish to compute the importance scores for, call `update_mxts()`. This will create the symbolic variables that compute the multipliers with respect to the layer specified in step 2.
4. Compile the importance score computation function with

    ```python
    deeplift.backend.function([input_layer.get_activation_vars()...,
                               input_layer.get_reference_vars()...],
                              blob_to_find_scores_for.get_target_contrib_vars())
    ```
    - The first argument represents the inputs to the function and should be a list of one symbolic tensor for the activations of each input layer (as for the forward pass), followed by a list of one symbolic tensor for the references of each input layer
    - The second argument represents the output of the function. In the example above, it is a single tensor containing the importance scores of a single blob, but it can also be a list of tensors if you wish to compute the scores for multiple blobs at once.
    - Instead of `get_target_contrib_vars()` which returns the importance scores (in the case of `NonlinearMxtsMode.DeepLIFT`, these are called "contribution scores"), you can use `get_mxts()` to get the multipliers.
5. Now you are ready to call the function to find the importance scores.
    - Select a specific output blob to compute importance scores with respect to by calling `set_active()` on the blob.
    - Select a specific target neuron within the blob by calling `update_task_index(task_idx)` on the blob. Here `task_idx` is the index of a neuron within the blob.
    - Call the function compiled in step 4 to find the importance scores for the target neuron. Refer to step 4 in the forward pass section for tips on using `deeplift.util.run_function_in_batches` to do this.
    - Deselect the output blob by calling `set_inactive()` on the blob. Don't forget this!
    - (Yes, I will bundle all of these into a single function at some point)
