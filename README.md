# deepLIFT (Learning Important FeaTures)

"Not Just a Black Box: Learning Important Features Through Propagating Activation Differences"

deepLIFT is "an efficient and effective method for computing importance scores in a neural network" proposed by Shrikumar, Peyton,  Shcherbina, and Kundaje (2016). The paper is publicly available via [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01713).

### Getting Started

* The master branch is operational with an older version of Keras (0.3.2).
* The experimental `keras-1-compatability` branch is being developed for compatability with newer versions of Keras (1.0.X). 

`examples/mnist/dnn_mnist.py` is a concise example of using deepLIFT (see `keras-1-compatability` branch).
